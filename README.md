# Hello there üëã

## ‚ú® Who am I? 

That's a fair question. I'm Alex Foxleigh and it's very nice to meet you. I'm a freelance UI engineer, mostly focused on NodeJs and React.js. I work primarily in the public sector and was one of the founding creators of the [MOD.UK Design System](https://design-system.digital.mod.uk/). 

I've also worked with various government/military agencies including (but not limited to):

- [The Cabinet Office 'COBR' team](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/cobr-cobra) during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis.
- [The NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/)
- [DEFRA](https://www.defra.gov.uk/)
- [The Royal Navy](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/)
- [The Home Office](https://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/)
- [The Ministry of Justice](https://www.justice.gov.uk/)
- [The Department for International Trade](https://www.trade.gov.uk/)

I'm a big smart-home enthusiast and a general automation nerd (blog post coming soon).

## ‚öôÔ∏è &nbsp; I‚Äôm currently working on

- My day-to-day work is focused on building a design system for an undisclosed government agency. Sadly, I'm not able to talk about that any further.
- A new blog system, I run a couple of blogs and am terrible at keeping them up to date (to the point where I'm ashamed to share any links). My current ones are gatsby based and use just plain markdown for the 'cms' but I am working on a new system that will be based on [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and will allow me to have one CMS for all of my blogs. The front-end will be in [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) and I'm hoping that with the exception of a few environment variables and stylsheets, I'll be able to use the same code-base for each blog, making it super easy to keep them all up to date.
- A Todoist Chores management app for families, I have a [basic MVP](https://github.com/foxleigh81/autochore) of this up and running already but right now it heavily relies on 3rd party integrations such as [automate.io](https://automate.io), [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), [Node-red](https://nodered.org) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs). This is actually a perfect sytem for my personal needs but I can see a use-case for it for families as well and that will need to be a little more robust and unified. 
- As always, I'm working on my smart home, this is a huge undertaking with a lot of moving parts, it's ostensibly based around [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) using [Node-Red](https://nodered.org) for all of it's automations. I plan on writing a few blog posts about it soon.

## üì´ &nbsp; How to reach me

 Keep an eye on my [Website](https://www.alexfoxleigh.com/) (and here) for my availability and updates. I'm generally not free for smaller freelance projects as I tend to focus on one client at a time and my availability is limited. However, I'm always happy to chat about potential projects, so if you have something that you think I may find exciting, please get in touch.

Rather than share my contact details here and risk getting spammed, I'd recommend you get in touch with me via LinkedIn.
