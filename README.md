## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

- A new blog system, I run a couple of blogs and am terrible at keeping them up to date. My current ones are gatsby based and use just plain markdown for the 'cms' but I am working on a new system that will be based on [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and will allow me to have one CMS for all of my blogs. The front-end will be in [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) and I'm hoping that with the exception of a few environment variables and stylsheets, I'll be able to use the same code-base for each blog, making it super easy to keep them all up to date.
- A Todoist Chores management app for families, I have a [basic MVP](https://github.com/foxleigh81/autochore) of this up and running already but right now it heavily relies on 3rd party integrations such as [automate.io](https://automate.io), [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), [Node-red](https://nodered.org) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs). This is actually a perfect sytem for my personal needs but I can see a use-case for it for families as well and that will need to be a litte more robust and unified. 
- As always, I'm working on my smart home, this is a huge undertaking with a lot of moving parts, it's ostensibly based around [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) using [Node-Red](https://nodered.org) for all of it's automations. I plan on writing a few blog posts about it soon.
