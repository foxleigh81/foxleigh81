## ‚ú® Who am I? 

That's a fair question. I'm Alex Foxleigh and it's very nice to meet you. I'm a frontend technical architect/tech lead, mostly focused on NodeJs and React.js. I was the founding developer of the [Royal Navy Design System](https://storybook.design-system.navy.digital.mod.uk/?path=/docs/getting-started--docs). 

I've also worked with various government/military agencies including (but not limited to):

- [The Cabinet Office 'COBR' team](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/cobr-cobra) during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis.
- [The NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/)
- [DEFRA](https://www.defra.gov.uk/)
- [The Royal Navy](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/)
- [The Home Office](https://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/)
- [The Ministry of Justice](https://www.justice.gov.uk/)
- [The Department for International Trade](https://www.trade.gov.uk/)
- The UK Intelligence community

I'm a big smart-home enthusiast and a general automation nerd (blog post coming soon).

## ‚öôÔ∏è &nbsp; I‚Äôm currently working on

- A Chores management app for families, I have a [basic MVP](https://github.com/foxleigh81/autochore) of this up and running already but right now it heavily relies on 3rd party integrations such as [automate.io](https://automate.io) (which is now discontinued!), [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), [Node-red](https://nodered.org) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs). This is actually a perfect sytem for my personal needs but I can see a use-case for it for families as well and that will need to be a little more robust and unified. 
- An app to assist people when moving house
- [CV Blaster](https://github.com/foxleigh81/cv-blaster) A python/next tool to help people to manage their CV's online
- As always, I'm working on my smart home, this is a huge undertaking with a lot of moving parts, it's ostensibly based around [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) using [Node-Red](https://nodered.org) for all of it's automations. I plan on writing a few blog posts about it soon.

## üì´ &nbsp; How to reach me

 Keep an eye on my [Website](https://www.alexfoxleigh.com/) (and here) for my availability and updates. I'm generally not free for smaller freelance projects as I tend to focus on one client at a time and my availability is limited. However, I'm always happy to chat about potential projects, so if you have something that you think I may find exciting, please get in touch.

Rather than share my contact details here and risk getting spammed, I'd recommend you get in touch with me via LinkedIn.
