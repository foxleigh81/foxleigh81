## ‚ú® Who am I? 

That's a fair question. I'm Alex Foxleigh and it's very nice to meet you. I'm a freelance UI engineer, mostly focused on NodeJs and React.js. I work primarily in the public sector and was one of the founding creators of the [MOD.UK Design System](https://design-system.digital.mod.uk/). 

I've also worked with various government/military sections including (but not limited to):

- [The Cabinet Office 'COBR' team](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/cobr-cobra) during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis.
- [The NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/)
- [DEFRA](https://www.defra.gov.uk/)
- [The Royal Navy](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/)
- [The Home Office](https://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/)
- [The Ministry of Justice](https://www.justice.gov.uk/)
- [The Department for International Trade](https://www.trade.gov.uk/)

I'm a big smart-home enthusiast and a general automation nerd (blog post coming soon).

## ‚öôÔ∏è &nbsp; I‚Äôm currently working on

- A new blog system, I run a couple of blogs and am terrible at keeping them up to date. My current ones are gatsby based and use just plain markdown for the 'cms' but I am working on a new system that will be based on [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and will allow me to have one CMS for all of my blogs. The front-end will be in [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) and I'm hoping that with the exception of a few environment variables and stylsheets, I'll be able to use the same code-base for each blog, making it super easy to keep them all up to date.
- A Todoist Chores management app for families, I have a [basic MVP](https://github.com/foxleigh81/autochore) of this up and running already but right now it heavily relies on 3rd party integrations such as [automate.io](https://automate.io), [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), [Node-red](https://nodered.org) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs). This is actually a perfect sytem for my personal needs but I can see a use-case for it for families as well and that will need to be a litte more robust and unified. 
- As always, I'm working on my smart home, this is a huge undertaking with a lot of moving parts, it's ostensibly based around [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) using [Node-Red](https://nodered.org) for all of it's automations. I plan on writing a few blog posts about it soon. 

## üì´ &nbsp; How to reach me

 Keep an eye on my [Website](https://www.alexfoxleigh.com/) (and here) for my availability and updates. I'm generally not free for freelance projects as I tend to focus on one client at a time and my availability is limited. However, I'm always happy to chat about potential projects, so if you have something that you think I may find exciting, please get in touch.

Rather than share my contact details here and risk getting spammed, I'd recommend you get in touch with me via LinkedIn.
